# Jarvis Search Functionality - Fixed for Year-Specific Searches

## Problem
Jarvis was unable to properly search for information related to specific years (like 2025) because the search implementation was adding "current information" context to all queries, which interfered with searches for future or specific years.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Year Detection
I've added a smart detection function that identifies when a user is searching for a specific year:

```python
def is_year_search(query: str) -> bool:
    """Detect if the query is specifically searching for a year"""
    # Check if query contains a 4-digit year (like 2025)
    year_pattern = r'\b(19|20)\d{2}\b'
    years = re.findall(year_pattern, query)
    
    # If we find years in the query, check if they're the main focus
    if years:
        # Simple heuristic: if query is short and contains a year, it's likely a year search
        if len(query.split()) <= 4:
            return True
        # Check if query explicitly mentions the year
        for year in years:
            if str(year) in query:
                return True
    return False
```

### 2. Adaptive Search Strategy
The search function now intelligently adapts its behavior based on the query type:

#### For Year-Specific Searches (like "2025 technology trends"):
- Searches are performed without adding "current information" context
- Results are presented without current date/time stamps
- Preserves the specific year context in the search

#### For Current Searches (like "current weather"):
- Adds current date/time context for relevance
- Includes timestamps in results to show when search was performed
- Enhances queries with "current information" for better results

### 3. Implementation Details

The enhanced search functions now check if a query is year-specific before modifying it:

```python
# Check if this is a year-specific search
if not is_year_search(query):
    # Add current context to query for current searches
    current_time = format_current_time()
    enhanced_query = f"{query} current information {current_time}"
else:
    # For year-specific searches, use the query as-is
    enhanced_query = query
```

### 4. Benefits

1. **Year-Specific Searches Work**: Jarvis can now properly search for information about 2025, 2030, etc.
2. **Current Searches Still Work**: Current information searches still get enhanced context
3. **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically detects the type of search and adapts accordingly
4. **Better User Experience**: More accurate results for both current and future-date searches

### 5. Testing

Created `test_year_search.py` to verify the functionality:
- Tests year detection for various query types
- Tests actual searches for specific years (2025, 2030, etc.)
- Ensures current searches still work properly

## How It Works

1. When Jarvis receives a search query, it first checks if it's a year-specific search
2. For year-specific searches, it performs the search as-is without modifications
3. For current searches, it enhances the query with current context for better results
4. Results are formatted appropriately with or without timestamps based on search type

## Examples

### Year-Specific Search:
Query: "2025 technology predictions"
Result: Returns information specifically about 2025 technology predictions without adding current context

### Current Search:
Query: "current weather"
Result: Returns current weather information with a timestamp showing when the search was performed

This fix ensures that Jarvis can now properly handle both current information searches and specific year searches like "2025".
