# Jarvis Google Search Solution

## Problem
Jarvis is unable to perform Google searches because:
1. The Google Custom Search API is not enabled in the Google Cloud project
2. The required API keys are not properly configured
3. There are dependency conflicts with LiveKit modules

## Solution Overview

### 1. Enable Google Custom Search API
Based on the documentation in `GOOGLE_API_SETUP.md`, you need to enable the Custom Search API:

1. Visit the Google Cloud Console:
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/overview?project=703401253493

2. Click on the "Enable" button to enable the Custom Search API for your project

3. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate through Google's systems

### 2. Configure API Keys
The required API keys are:
- **API Key**: AIzaSyB0b36lqutN3K7DHuPAuBPOnAhFYpfn8RU
- **Search Engine ID**: f469efe96a9aa4e2f

These should be set as environment variables:
```
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=AIzaSyB0b36lqutN3K7DHuPAuBPOnAhFYpfn8RU
SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=f469efe96a9aa4e2f
```

### 3. Fix Dependency Issues
The main search functionality has been updated to remove LiveKit dependencies:

1. The `jarvis_search.py` file has been modified to remove the `@function_tool` decorator
2. The `test_imports.py` file has been updated to remove LiveKit imports
3. A fallback mechanism using DuckDuckGo search has been implemented

### 4. Test the Integration
After enabling the API, run the final test:

```bash
python final_test.py
```

The output should show:
```
Final Result: 4/4 tests passed
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! The Google Search integration is working correctly.
```

## Alternative Solution: Simple Agent
If you still experience issues, you can use the simple agent implementation:

```python
# simple_agent.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from jarvis_search import google_search

load_dotenv()

def main():
    print("Jarvis Assistant - Simple Version")
    print("=================================")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit")
    print()
    
    while True:
        query = input("Enter your search query: ").strip()
        
        if query.lower() == 'quit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
            
        if not query:
            print("Please enter a valid query.")
            continue
            
        print("Searching...")
        result = google_search(query)
        print(result)
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run with:
```bash
python simple_agent.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get import errors:
1. Ensure all required packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install google-api-python-client duckduckgo-search python-dotenv requests
   ```

2. Remove any LiveKit dependencies that cause conflicts

### If you get API errors:
1. Verify the API key is correct
2. Ensure the Custom Search API is enabled in the Google Cloud Console
3. Check that the Search Engine ID is properly configured

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure the API key has permissions for the Custom Search API
2. Check the Google Cloud Console for quota exceeded warnings

## Verification
Once everything is set up correctly, you should be able to:
1. Import the `google_search` function without errors
2. Perform searches that return relevant results
3. See properly formatted search results with titles, snippets, and links

The search function intelligently handles both current information searches and specific year searches, adding context about when the search was performed for current information queries.
